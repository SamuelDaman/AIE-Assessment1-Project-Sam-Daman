This is a project made for AIE programming assessment 1.


This is a game where you run a shop in an RPG setting.

You are able to sell items to customers, barter for the customer's items, or buy goods from producers for a fixed price.
You're also able to use your materials to craft items yourself, or you can pay some money and spend less materials to order the items from a smith.

There are different types of customers that the game chooses at random.
Each customer type has a different budget, tolerance for price markups, limit on how many items the are willing to buy and sell, and interest in different items etc.

At the end of each day, the you have to pay rent and eat food.
If you don't have enough food by the end of the day, you will be forced to buy the amount of food needed.
If you don't have enough money to buy the food or pay rent you will lose.
